Apps and packages that need to be installed:
- WSL 2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
- ubuntu app for windows (UBUNTU 20.04.6 LTS) 
- gurobi 
- snakemake 
- python 3.10.11 with mamba

Installing WLS and ubuntu: https://www.minitool.com/partition-disk/install-ubuntu-on-windows-11.html
Installing snakemake: https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html
Gurobi: https://support.gurobi.com/hc/en-us/articles/13232844297489-How-do-I-set-up-a-Web-License-Service-WLS-license-

Workflow:
- Run the ubuntu app as admin
- Run in the command line:

mamba activate snakemake
cd /mnt/c/Users/... (put the current working directory with all the files) 
snakemake -j 2
At some point the code will crash (it can't do the plotting in parallel). At this point run snakemake -j 1 to finish the process

If the code crashes giving a "Killed" error, try to run snakemake -j 1. This will use one core only, it is slower but may solve the issue.
Depending on the PC hardware, it might be wise to run only a few scenarios at the same time. 

After it successfully finished, run in python:
- CreateScatterPlot -> sorts the results metrics by scenario and creates ValuesRanked.xlsx
- calc_ratios -> calculates the potential usage of FPVs and the locations with largest usage and largest capacity
- calc differences -> creates the differential charts
The output files of this scripts will be saved in the ScenarioComparison folder

Script order:

Within snakemake workflow:
- excel_to_osemosys
- CBC_results_AS_MODEX
- run osemosys
- generate_pickle
- generate_results
- ResultsCalc
- rename_files
- create_excels
Outside snakemake worflow:
- CreateScatterPlot
- calc_ratios 
- calc differences
